# Project Proposal

### Project title
SmartTravel

### What and why?
SmartTravel is an AI-powered travel app that integrates interactive maps, user-generated travel guides and AI-based recommendations. The app combines user insights with real-time web recommendations to solve the challenge of fragmented travel information. Travelers often struggle to find relevant and up-to-date travel tips, food recommendations and points of interest. The app provides a unified platform where users can share experiences, get AI-powered recommendations, and explore destinations efficiently.

### For whom?

- Traveler: Individuals who explore new places and need quick, well-planned travel recommendations.
- Local Explorers: Residents who want to discover new attractions and hidden treasures in the city.
- Travel bloggers and content creators: Users who want to contribute their experiences and gain visibility in the travel community.

### How?

Provides interactive travel maps that allow users to explore destinations, view attractions and get real-time advice. Users can create and interact with user-generated travel guides to share itineraries, suggestions and personal experiences. The application includes food and activity recommendations, enabling users to browse and provide food and activity suggestions based on real-life experiences. Through artificial intelligence suggestions, the system analyzes web resources and user data to provide personalized travel advice. A review and rating system allows users to rate tourist attractions, leave reviews and participate in community insights. The app also supports offline access, allowing travelers to download maps and guides for offline use. Finally, integration with external sources allows relevant data to be extracted from external travel sources such as Google Reviews and TripAdvisor to enhance recommendations.

### Scope

 Leveraging existing APIs such as Google Maps and OpenAI for core functionality while integrating user-generated content is achievable. Adding AI-driven recommendations and external data integration adds a layer of complexity that makes it a challenging but feasible project. Additionally, the system will be designed to allow for future scalability, such as real-time collaboration and AR-based navigation, thus ensuring long-term value and practical implementation.
